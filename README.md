Steps:
1. Load the environmental and species datasets
2. Set resolution and extent - Sweden 50 meters
3. Spatial block cross validation using blockCV package to separate training and testing sets
4. Formating data
6. Models options
7. Models fitting
8. Model evaluation
9. Model fitting with one model without slipt data
10. Projection to Sweden extention (current distribution)
11. Projection to future climatic conditions
